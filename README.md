# mini-stark

In this repo I implement a stark prover for learning purposes using arkworks.
**Do not use this in a production environment.**

ðŸš§ This repo is WIP ðŸš§ I intend to add more features with time.

currently system status:

- Complete âœ…
- Soundness :x:
- Non-interactive âœ…
- Succint âœ…
- Zero-Knowledge âœ…

Issues/comments/critics all very welcome.

## Roadmap

Planned features(in no specific order):

- [x] add Fiat-Shamir
- [x] commit to multiple polynomials
- [x] add support for AIR arithmetization
- [x] extend `merkle.rs` to get trees with 4/8 nodes
- [x] add zk: random trace padding and domain coset
- [x] Stark PIOP
  - [ ] add DEEP-ALI to IOPP ðŸš§
- [ ] Add `rayon` for parallelization
- [ ] Add `criterion` and integration tests to benchmark performance
- [ ] perf optimizations such as:
  - [ ] griding
  - [ ] STIR ??
  - [ ] WHIR ??
  - [ ] ..

## Reference

Here is a list of some resources, I used:

- The IOPP has been mostly taken from [stark-by-hand by risc0](https://dev.risczero.com/proof-system/stark-by-hand) and to a lesser degree from [anatomy of a STARK](https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/stark).
- FRI is based [anatomy of a STARK](https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/stark) and [Chp.8 of zk-learning.org](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/zk-learning/assets/lecture8.pdf) on that order.
- For the AIR arithmetization, I took great inspiration from [OpenZK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3AKu03AwYc). [Notes on air arithmetization](https://cronokirby.com/posts/2022/09/notes-on-stark-arithmetization/) is a very good primer on air.
- I took FRI-batching from risc0 knowledge database
